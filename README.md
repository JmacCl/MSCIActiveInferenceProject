# Formal Verification of Discrete Active Inference Systems in PRISM

## Application

This applicaiton is intended to do 2 things

1. Experiment, analyze and compare between different decision theory problems
2. Create stochastic systems/markov systems and formally verify properties from specified decision theory paradigms/ 


## Goals

- **Verify Active Inference Properties:**
  - Active Inference has the potential to model the generative process for how intelligent biological organism interact with their external environments
  - A key goal in this project is to specify and then verify properties within Active Inference systems
- **Comparison with Reinforcement Learning and PRISM**
